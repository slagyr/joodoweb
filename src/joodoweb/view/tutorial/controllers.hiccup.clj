[:h3 "Building Our Controller"]
[:p "By default our controller directory is empty. However as projects grow, this directory becomes more and more important. The files that go here contain additional routes that are related to each other. For our purposes, we will want to create a posts controller that has all of the routing information for our blog posts."]
[:p "To make our posts controller and posts controller tester, create these two files: " [:b "src/sample_app/controller/post_controller.clj"] " and " [:b "spec/sample_app/controller/post_controller_spec.clj"]]

[:p "This file uses Speclj along with Joodo spec helpers to test out the post controller page. The call to the 'with-mock-rendering' function tells Joodo to keep track of all files rendered without actually rendering them. The with-routes function tells Joodo to use the routes listed in the specified var (in our case it is post-controller). We also need to ':refer' to the controller functions we'll be using to test our controller."]
[:p "Within our test we are asserting that if a client sends a get request to the /post uri, they will get a response with a status of 404, the not_found page will display, and an error message will get passed."]
[:p "Now run your tests from the terminal by using the " [:b "lein spec -a"] " command"]
[:p "You should get an error message stating that no namespace called sample_app.controller.post-controller exists. Let's remedy that by pasting the following code into the " [:b "src/sample_app/controller/post_controller.clj"] " file we created:"]

[:p "This defines our post-controller var and populates it with one route. When the " [:b "/post"] " route hits, the response is sent back with a status of 404, a body filled with the data stored in the not_found template, and an error message gets passed through as a flash message."]
[:p "A common mistake for controllers is not starting your route with the controller name. For example, we can't list routes in our post controller that start with anything other than post. Another important thing to note is that if we don't include a var named post-controller, none of our routes will get loaded. So if you had a controller named happy_controller.clj, Joodo will expect a var called happy-controller to exist and contain all of the routes from that controller."]
